This project is from [The odin project HTML and CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/embedding-images-and-video).

It consists of recreate  YouTubeâ€™s video player page. It only has html and css so any feature work. It is not responsive, it was made for fullscreen desktop view.

**UPDATE:** Google has flagged the page as phishing. I have added a disclaimer to make it clear that is a mockup.
